My personal homepage.

It's a work in process.

`index.html` should be the face of the homepage, where it describes what my homepage is about.

`aboutme.html` should be about myself. What I do, what my ideals are, what I'm about.

`portfolio.html` should be divided between work and personal. Personal section will describe my personal projects.

Each project should have their repository referenced. We'll see if we can somehow integrate working examples, or at least, codepen it.

`Porjects.md` is for keeping track of my personal projects.
